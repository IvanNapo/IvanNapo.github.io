Hello! I’m Ivan Napoli, a PhD candidate in *Economics of Innovation* at **Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore** in Milan.

My research explores the intersection between **artificial intelligence** and **social sustainability**, with a particular focus on how digital technologies shape educational and inclusion opportunities.

I am currently investigating the impact of **large language models** on the research practices and productivity of PhD students, as part of a broader effort to understand the socio-economic implications of AI adoption in academic and professional contexts.

My interests span AI impact analysis, education, and financial inclusion.

This website serves as a space to share ongoing work, collaborations, and reflections on digital transformation.  

I believe in research that is rigorous, socially relevant, and openly communicated.

A real **“about me”**? I have a *mild* obsession with world flags, and *Midnight in Paris* is my guilty-pleasure rewatch.  

Current read: *The Business Reinvention of Japan: How to Make Sense of the "new Japan" and Why It Matters* by Ulrike Schaede.
